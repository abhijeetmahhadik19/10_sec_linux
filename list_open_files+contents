#Sometimes you need to list a bunch of files contents in a directory
#you can do 
cat file1 file2 file3
#if you need to list all the contents of all the files in a directory then you can simple change to that directory
cd /absolute_path_to_that_directory
cat *
#But this only shows the contents inside the file and will not give an idea about which filename contains which contet
#To show whih file contans what content
cd /absolute_path_to_that_directory
tail -n +1 *
#or 
tail -n +1 file1 file2 file3
